Create Account
Create Project -->
  Projects are good way to organize and manage the project in different env.
  
  Each project has 3 identifiers -->
    Project name --> Human friendly/readable, to identify the project easily
    Project ID --> Created by User, globally unique, and can be used in Cloud SDK, CLI, etc
    Project number --> Google created globally generated unique ID/number

IAM --> to add members and set multiple roles to that member.
Members email id must be somehow linked to Google in-order to add that email as a member in the project.

IAM doesn't serve as an Identity provider.
IAM serves as Who can do what and to which GCP resource. However who needs to be known to Google somehow.

One of the following can become a member:
1. Google account email
2. google group email
3. service account
4. Gsuit domain

GSuit (earlier called as Google Apps for work) --> gives businesses access to email, drives, etc
Cloud Identity --> identity provider aspect of GSuit without the rest of the Gsuit apps
GCDS --> service that allows you to sync AD or LDAP.
     --> Its possible to use any other identity provider if its supported by G cloud directory sink (GCDS). you can sync users with Active Directory or an LDAP server.
     
Roles --> One of the way to give permissions to members to perform any activity.
Types of Roles --> 3 types
1. Primitive Roles --> Project Owner, Project viewer, Project Editor
2. Predefined Roles --> more granular and service specific roles (example: ML Engine Developer)
3. Custom Roles --> Created by Admin, Same functionality as predefined roles. (example: Role Name: View ML jobs, Permissions: ml.jobs.list)
