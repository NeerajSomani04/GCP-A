Create Account
Create Project -->
  Projects are good way to organize and manage the project in different env.
  
  Each project has 3 identifiers -->
    Project name --> Human friendly/readable, to identify the project easily
    Project ID --> Created by User, globally unique, and can be used in Cloud SDK, CLI, etc
    Project number --> Google created globally generated unique ID/number

IAM --> to add members and set multiple roles to that member.
Members email id must be somehow linked to Google in-order to add that email as a member in the project.

IAM doesn't serve as an Identity provider.
IAM serves as Who can do what and to which GCP resource. However who needs to be known to Google somehow.

One of the following can become a member:
1. Google account email
2. google group email
3. service account
4. Gsuit domain

GSuit (earlier called as Google Apps for work) --> gives businesses access to email, drives, etc
Cloud Identity --> identity provider aspect of GSuit without the rest of the Gsuit apps
GCDS --> service that allows you to sync AD or LDAP.
     --> Its possible to use any other identity provider if its supported by G cloud directory sink (GCDS). you can sync users with Active Directory or an LDAP server.
     
Roles --> One of the way to give permissions to members to perform any activity.
Types of Roles --> 3 types
1. Primitive Roles --> (project level) Project Owner, Project viewer, Project Editor 
2. Predefined Roles --> (resource level) more granular and service specific roles (example: ML Engine Developer) 
3. Custom Roles --> (resource level) Created by Admin, Same functionality as predefined roles. (example: Role Name: View ML jobs, Permissions: ml.jobs.list)

Enable APIs --> This allows us to select any available API from Library to select and enable for Application.
API can be public or Private and can be ditributed in different categories.

API Overview window provides details about API performance and activity happening at API.
you can filter result by API versions, API methods, API response codes.

API Quota --> will inform us about monthly / yearly quota limit.

GCP allows user to Explore APIs using API Explorer -->
  you can select different API versions, and pass input to that API using browser and then check the result.

Cloud Shell --> Is also one one the awesome feature of GCP, which is Shell window in broswer.

In-order to use any API we need API credentials --> (Need to check this later)

Stackdriver --> Google's monitoring and logging service. It can monitor one or more projects.
It contains various services like, monitoring, logging, debug, trace, error reporting, profiler.

Groups --> we can create groups to monitor services together that are used in specific project.

Application Performance Management (APM) --> 

Host Project are common pratice to monitor projects in StackDriver.
Best practice recommendation --> 
  if you are using only 1 project to monitor, you can use same project as Host project.
  But if you using StackDriver to monitor multiple project together then you need to create Host Project (an empty project) and add your existing project into it to monitor.
  
Summary -->
Resources --> Compute Enginer, Cloud Storage, App Engine, etc. 
Services --> These resources combines and makes up a services.
1. Project --> Services and Resources attached to a project. 
        --> Projects can have Add members, enable billing, Manage Roles, and all other needed resources.
    --> Everything is attached to a project but structure of project depends on need of Organization.
      example, one can create multiple project under one application or one application per project.
           --> one can create per project per department or per functionality of application or per team like dev, test and prod.
2. IAM (Users and Roles) --> Who can do what with which resource. 
      Users has to be somehow associated with Google.
3. Manage APIs --> using Console, SDK
4. StackDriver --> 


Create Billing Account --> consist of Payment methods, permissions (Billing Roles) and can be attach to one or more projects.
We can create as many billing account as we want and attach them to as many projects as we want.


When will be billed? Depends on how we use.
1. Self-serve accounts --> monthly or billed at threshold. By default account is of this type.
2. Invoiced --> Billed monthly, Check / Wire Transfer/ contact Google Cloud Sales team to set-up this.

Who have access to Billing Info --> depends on Role 
Primitive Role --> Owner
Predefined --> (Billing Viewer, User, Admin)
Custom Roles --> 

Create Budgets & Alert --> manage our budget
Budgets --> can be created based on Billing Account level or Project level.
Alerts --> can be set based on percentage of budget or specific Amount. (trigger notification)

Notifications can be received by pub/sub topic to this budget.

Below are few of the info that can be seen in Notification --> in JSON format
 --> BudgetDisplayName
 alertThresholdExceed
 costAmount
 costIntervalStart
 budgetrAmount
 budgetAmountType
 currentCode

Billing Export --> two ways 
    BigQuery export --> more detailed info, allows to query using BigQuery. Analysis reports can be created on top of it.
    File Export --> in CSV or JSON file format, can be saved at Cloud Storage bucket everyday. few less info then BigQuery. little cheap as well. One file per day.
    
Cloud Storage Bucket --> (very similar to AWS S3)
  Bucket name --> global unique name
  different storage classes --> Multi-regional, regional, Nearline, Coldline
  Location --> us-west1
  pricing --> depends on Storage-Cost, retrieval cost, class A operations, class B operations
